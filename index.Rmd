## What is BMI?

BMI or Body Mass Index is a simple metric that gives an indication of whether a person is underweight, overweight or a healthy weight.

$$latex
BMI = \frac{mass}{height^2}
$$

where mass is in kg and height is in metres.

It is independent of age (although it isn't appropriate for children) and works equally well for both genders. For example
```{r}
mass <- 60
height  <- 1.8

bmi <- mass/height^2
bmi
```

## How does the app work?

CheckMyBMI is very simple to use

It is hosted on the web at https://kendra.shinyapps.io/newApp and will work with any modern browser or even on a smartphone.

The user simply enters their mass and height and presses "Go calculate!"
